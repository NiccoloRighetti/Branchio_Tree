# Branchio_New_Analyses
Commands for new analyses on dating the phylogeny of Branchiopoda (Crustacea) with different methods.  
Pipeline for new analyses:
1. Gene concordance factor on the folder used for generating the ultrametric tree that has been dated.
2. In case there are enough genes which supports the main nodes, re-do the dating on a new ultrametric tree generated by this subset of genes.
